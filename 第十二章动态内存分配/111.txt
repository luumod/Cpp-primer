Why is this?
 The reason is that
 the strange and bitter
 miracle of life is nowhere
 else so evident as in our 
youth. And what is the 
essence of that strange
 and bitter miracle of life
 which we feel so poignant
so unutterable£¬ with such
 a bitter pain and joy£¬ 
when we are young? It is
 this£º that being rich£¬
 we are so poor£»
 that being mighty£¬ 
we can yet have nothing
that seeing£¬ breathig£¬ 
smelling£¬ tasting all around
 us the impossible wealth
 and glory of this earth£¬
 feeling with an intolerable
 certitude that the whole
 structure of the enchanted
 life ¨C the most fortunate£¬
 wealthy£¬ good£¬ and happy
 life that any man has ever
 known ¨C is ours ¨C is ours at
 once£¬ immediately and
 forever£¬ the moment 
that we choose to take a
 step£¬ or stretch a hand
or say a word¡ª¡ª we yet 
know that we can really keep
 hold£¬ take£¬ and possess forever
¡ª¡ª nothing. All passes£»
 nothing lasts£º the moment
 that we put our hand upon it 
£¬ it melts away like smoke
£¬ is gone forever£¬ and the
 snake is eating at our heart 
again£» we see then what we
 are and what our lives must come to.
